### 1. Data Collection (Web Scraping)

In this phase, we gather data from the CoinMarketCap website using web scraping techniques. We focus on extracting information related to the top 200 cryptocurrencies on a specific date (08/25/2023) and prepare it in a tabular format.

### 2. Database Design and Data Storage

- Define main entities (e.g., coins, prices) and relationships between them.
- Specify data attributes for each entity.
- Utilize normalization techniques to ensure data integrity and minimize redundancy.
- Use web scraping tools to extract desired data and store it in our database.

### 3. Data Analysis

Explore the project data through statistical tests and charts. Some key analyses include:

- Scatter plot to check the relationship between Market Cap and Volume 24h.
- Identify cryptocurrency pairs with the most days of price changes in a recent year.
- Daily trading volume distribution of mineable cryptocurrencies.
- Correlation matrix for price changes of the top 16 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.
- Identify the top 10 cryptocurrencies with the most price increases during red days in spring 2023.

### 4. Dashboarding with Power BI

Using Power BI, visualize insights and patterns discovered during data analysis. Create an attractive analytical dashboard to provide a comprehensive view of cryptocurrency trends and metrics.
